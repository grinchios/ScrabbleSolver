Scrabble word solver using official scrabble wordlist

Created: 13/03/17

Just a 'simple' script that takes an input and then splits this into a list based on each character. It then checks if the possible word can be made with the letters out of the input.

Some issues are with outputs and also keeping the code readable, adding comments is how I'm doing it currently but I'm still learning so the OOP aspect of the code is severely lacking I know. Possibly in the future I'll re-write it focusing on OOP more. 

[31/03/2017] OOP has been greatly introduced and has significantly lowered execution times. Still needs some work with the definitions since they're the bottleneck now.

Hope it all works, any questions email me :)
